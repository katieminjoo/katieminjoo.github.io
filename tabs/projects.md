Here are some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on, each one focused on solving a specific problem with data and machine learning.

---

### üîã [Battery Swapping Station Location Optimization](/projects/battery-swapping/)
Geospatial modeling to support where to install battery stations across Korea.  
Used population, rider mobility, and slope data to predict local demand.  
*Tools: XGBoost, geopandas, folium*

---

### üê∂ [Dog Facial Expression Synthesis with StarGAN_v2](/projects/dog-facial-synthesis/)
Fine-tuned a GAN to generate emotion-based dog faces while keeping breed and fur color intact.  
Focused on disentangling identity from expression.  
*Tools: StarGAN_v2, EfficientDet, histogram loss*

---

### üìö [Policy Knowledge Graph from Korean Development Reports](/projects/policy-kg/)
Extracted entities and relations from Korean policy reports to build a searchable knowledge graph.  
NER with BERT+CRF, relation extraction with R-BERT.  
*Tools: BERT, R-BERT, Neo4j*

---

### üõ† [Anomaly Detection for Welding Defects](/projects/welding-defect/)
Built an anomaly detection system using sensor signal transformations and CNNs.  
Used in real production to flag subtle welding failures.  
*Tools: STFT, Isolation Forest, 1D-CNN*

---

### üî• [Electrode Surface Temperature Forecasting](/projects/electrode-temperature/)
Deployed a custom time series model for surface temperature control during battery manufacturing.  
Helped shift from rule-based to model-based control logic.  
*Tools: LSTM, Attention, factory deployment*
