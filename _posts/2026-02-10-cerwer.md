When working with **Speech-to-Text (STT)** systems, the most common way to quantify transcription quality is through **CER (Character Error Rate)** and **WER (Word Error Rate)**.  
This post explains what CER/WER mean, when each metric is useful.

---

## ✅ Goal

By the end of this post, you’ll be able to:

- Understand what **CER** and **WER** measure
- Know how they are computed (intuition + formula)
- Decide **when to use CER vs WER**

---

## 🧠 What Are CER and WER?

Both CER and WER are based on **edit distance** (Levenshtein distance).  
They measure how many edits are required to transform the STT output into the ground-truth transcript.

Edits include:

- **Substitution (S)**: wrong character/word
- **Deletion (D)**: missing character/word
- **Insertion (I)**: extra character/word

---

## 🔤 CER (Character Error Rate)

**CER** evaluates errors at the **character level**.

### ✅ Formula

\[
CER = \frac{S + D + I}{N}
\]

- **S** = substitutions (characters)
- **D** = deletions (characters)
- **I** = insertions (characters)
- **N** = number of characters in the reference (ground truth)

### 🟢 When CER is especially useful

- Languages where spacing/word segmentation is tricky (e.g., Korean)
- You want sensitivity to **small spelling/particle changes**
- You care about **fine-grained** transcription quality

### How to interpret them
- 0–2%: Excellent on clean data.
- 2–10%: Good; errors may be noticeable.
- 10–20%: Usable with post-editing.
- 20%+: Significant quality issues. These ranges are context-dependent (domain, language, noise, fonts). Always compare against a baseline on the same test set. (Guidance based on common practice and tool docs.)

## 🧾 WER (Word Error Rate)

**WER** evaluates errors at the **word level**.

### ✅ Formula

\[
WER = \frac{S + D + I}{N}
\]

Same structure as CER, but counts are based on **words**, and **N** is the number of words in the reference.

### 🟢 When WER is especially useful

- English-like languages where words are clearly separated by spaces
- You want a metric aligned with “how readable the sentence is”
- Your downstream system treats STT output as word tokens

---

## 🆚 CER vs WER: Which One Should I Use?

Here’s a practical rule of thumb:

- If your language/tokenization is **ambiguous** → use **CER**
- If your language is **space-delimited** and word-based → use **WER**
- For Korean STT evaluation, many teams report **both**, but often rely more on **CER**.

---

## 📌 Notes That Make Your Metrics More Trustworthy

A few practical tips that improve interpretability:

- Always define **normalization rules** (numbers, punctuation, spacing, special tokens)
- Ensure the same **tokenization policy** is used consistently across time
- Report:
  - Average CER/WER
  - And if possible, breakdowns by scenario (e.g., consent vs general 상담)

---

## 📝 Conclusion

CER and WER are simple but powerful metrics to track STT quality.
