# Applying early_stopping in LightGBM

When using LightGBM, attempting to pass `early_stopping_rounds` directly to the `train()` function may result in the following error:

`TypeError: train() got an unexpected keyword argument 'early_stopping_rounds'`

To resolve this issue, you should use the `early_stopping` callback instead.

## ‚ùå Incorrect Code (Error Occurs)
```python
import lightgbm as lgb

lgb_model = lgb.train(params, lgb_train, valid_sets=[lgb_test], early_stopping_rounds=10)
```

Executing this code will raise a `TypeError`.

## ‚úÖ Correct Code (Using Callbacks for Early Stopping)
```python
import lightgbm as lgb
from lightgbm import early_stopping

callbacks = [early_stopping(stopping_rounds=50)]

# Train LightGBM model
lgb_model = lgb.train(params, lgb_train, valid_sets=[lgb_test], 
                      num_boost_round=100, callbacks=callbacks)
```

### üîπ Key Changes
- Instead of passing `early_stopping_rounds` directly to `train()`, use the `early_stopping` callback.
- Add `early_stopping(stopping_rounds=50)` to the `callbacks` list and pass it as an argument to `train()`.

With this approach, early stopping is correctly applied in LightGBM!
